Family Movie Night Research
=====================

An interactive scatter plot is generated using data aggregated by [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com).  
The inspiration for this project is Ben Moore's excellent post on the most overrated movies.  
Read it [here](https://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/what-are-the-most-overrated-films/).

Also, with plotting with Plotly, I was added by a helpful rOpenSci [post](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/04/17/plotly/).
