Family Movie Night
=====================

An interactive scatter plot is generated using data aggregated by [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com).  Please see my [blog post](http://www.wisdomordata.com/streaming-data-consciousness/2015/1/10/family-movie-night-1) for the visual.

The inspiration for this project is Ben Moore's excellent post on the most overrated movies.  
Read it [here](https://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/what-are-the-most-overrated-films/).

Also, with plotting with Plotly, I was added by a helpful rOpenSci [post](http://ropensci.org/blog/2014/04/17/plotly/).
